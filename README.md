# rockyou.txt-search

This is a simple script I made to search the rockyou.txt wordlist included with Kali.

You will need to either download a copy of rockyou.txt or allow the script to download and unzip it for you.

If you don't know how to use this here's instructions:

1. Open the directory in terminal (this won't work in Windows)
2. Type in "chmod -x search.sh" or "chmod 777 search.sh" you shouldn't need root for this but prepend sudo to the command if you do
3. Type in "./search.sh" to execute the script, prepend sudo if needed
4. Follow the on screen instructions
